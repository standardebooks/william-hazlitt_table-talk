    <h2 epub:type="title">On Milton's Sonnets</h2>
    <p>
      The great object of the Sonnet seems to be, to express in musical numbers,
      and as it were with undivided breath, some occasional thought or personal
      feeling, 'some fee-grief due to the poet's breast.' It is a sigh uttered
      from the fulness of the heart, an involuntary aspiration born and dying in
      the same moment. I have always been fond of Milton's Sonnets for this
      reason, that they have more of this personal and internal character than
      any others; and they acquire a double value when we consider that they
      come from the pen of the loftiest of our poets. Compared with <i>Paradise</i>
      Lost, they are like tender flowers that adorn the base of some proud
      column or stately temple. The author in the one could work himself up with
      unabated fortitude 'to the height of his great argument'; but in the other
      he has shown that he could condescend to men of low estate, and after the
      lightning and the thunderbolt of his pen, lets fall some drops of natural
      pity over hapless infirmity, mingling strains with the nightingale's,
      'most musical, most melancholy.' The immortal poet pours his mortal
      sorrows into our breasts, and a tear falls from his sightless orbs on the
      friendly hand he presses. The Sonnets are a kind of pensive record of past
      achievements, loves, and friendships, and a noble exhortation to himself
      to bear up with cheerful hope and confidence to the last. Some of them are
      of a more quaint and humorous character; but I speak of those only which
      are intended to be serious and pathetical.&mdash;I do not know indeed but
      they may be said to be almost the first effusions of this sort of natural
      and personal sentiment in the language. Drummond's ought perhaps to be
      excepted, were they formed less closely on the model of Petrarch's, so as
      to be often little more than translations of the Italian poet. But
      Milton's Sonnets are truly his own in allusion, thought, and
      versification. Those of Sir Philip Sydney, who was a great transgressor in
      his way, turn sufficiently on himself and his own adventures; but they are
      elaborately quaint and intricate, and more like riddles than sonnets. They
      are 'very tolerable and not to be endured.' Shakespear's, which some
      persons better informed in such matters than I can pretend to be, profess
      to cry up as 'the divine, the matchless, what you will,'&mdash;to say
      nothing of the want of point or a leading, prominent idea in most of them,
      are I think overcharged and monotonous, and as to their ultimate drift, as
      for myself, I can make neither head nor tail of it. Yet some of them, I
      own, are sweet even to a sense of faintness, luscious as the woodbine, and
      graceful and luxuriant like it. Here is one:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 From you have I been absent in the spring,
 When proud-pied April, dress'd in all his trim,
 Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing;
 That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him.
 Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell
 Of different flowers in odour and in hue,
 Could make me any summer's story tell,
 Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:
 Nor did I wonder at the lilies white,
 Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;
 They were but sweet, but figures of delight,
 Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.
 Yet seem'd it winter still, and you away,
 As with your shadow, I with these did play.
</pre>
    <p>
      I am not aware of any writer of Sonnets worth mentioning here till long
      after Milton, that is, till the time of Warton and the revival of a taste
      for Italian and for our own early literature. During the rage for French
      models the Sonnet had not been much studied. It is a mode of composition
      that depends entirely on <i>expression,</i> and this the French and
      artificial style gladly dispenses with, as it lays no particular stress on
      anything&mdash;except vague, general common-places. Warton's Sonnets are
      undoubtedly exquisite, both in style and matter; they are poetical and
      philosophical effusions of very delightful sentiment; but the thoughts,
      though fine and deeply felt, are not, like Milton's subjects, identified
      completely with the writer, and so far want a more individual interest.
      Mr. Wordsworth's are also finely conceived and high-sounding Sonnets. They
      mouth it well, and are said to be sacred to Liberty. Brutus's exclamation,
      'Oh Virtue, I thought thee a substance, but I find thee a shadow,' was not
      considered as a compliment, but as a bitter sarcasm. The beauty of
      Milton's Sonnets is their sincerity, the spirit of poetical patriotism
      which they breathe. Either Milton's or the living bard's are defective in
      this respect. There is no Sonnet of Milton's on the Restoration of Charles
      II. There is no Sonnet of Mr. Wordsworth's corresponding to that of 'the
      poet blind and bold' 'On the late Massacre in Piedmont.' It would be no
      niggard praise to Mr. Wordsworth to grant that he was either half the man
      or half the poet that Milton was. He has not his high and various
      imagination, nor his deep and fixed principle. Milton did not worship the
      rising sun, nor turn his back on a losing and fallen cause.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Such recantation had no charms for him!
</pre>
    <p>
      Mr. Southey has thought proper to put the author of <i>Paradise Lost</i>
      into his late Heaven, on the understood condition that he is 'no longer to
      kings and to hierarchs hostile.' In his lifetime he gave no sign of such
      an alteration; and it is rather presumptuous in the poet-laureate to
      pursue the deceased antagonist of Salmasius into the other world to
      compliment him with his own infirmity of purpose. It is a wonder he did
      not add in a note that Milton called him aside to whisper in his ear that
      he preferred the new English hexameters to his own blank verse!
    </p>
    <p>
      Our first of poets was one of our first of men. He was an eminent instance
      to prove that a poet is not another name for the slave of power and
      fashion, as is the case with painters and musicians&mdash;things without
      an opinion&mdash;and who merely aspire to make up the pageant and show of
      the day. There are persons in common life who have that eager curiosity
      and restless admiration of bustle and splendour, that sooner than not be
      admitted on great occasions of feasting and luxurious display, they will
      go in the character of livery-servants to stand behind the chairs of the
      great. There are others who can so little bear to be left for any length
      of time out of the grand carnival and masquerade of pride and folly, that
      they will gain admittance to it at the expense of their characters as well
      as of a change of dress. Milton was not one of these. He had too much of
      the <i>ideal</i> faculty in his composition, a lofty contemplative
      principle, and consciousness of inward power and worth, to be tempted by
      such idle baits. We have plenty of chanting and chiming in among some
      modern writers with the triumphs over their own views and principles; but
      none of a patient resignation to defeat, sustaining and nourishing itself
      with the thought of the justice of their cause, and with firm-fixed
      rectitude. I do not pretend to defend the tone of Milton's political
      writings (which was borrowed from the style of controversial divinity), or
      to say that he was right in the part he took,&mdash;I say that he was
      consistent in it, and did not convict himself of error: he was consistent
      in it in spite of danger and obloquy, 'on evil days though fallen, and
      evil tongues,' and therefore his character has the salt of honesty about
      it. It does not offend in the nostrils of posterity. He had taken his part
      boldly and stood to it manfully, and submitted to the change of times with
      pious fortitude, building his consolations on the resources of his own
      mind and the recollection of the past, instead of endeavouring to make
      himself a retreat for the time to come. As an instance of this we may take
      one of the best and most admired of these Sonnets, that addressed to
      Cyriac Skinner, on his own blindness:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Cyriac, this three years' day, these eyes, though clear,
 To outward view, of blemish or of spot,
 Bereft of light their seeing have forgot,
 Nor to their idle orbs doth sight appear
 Of sun or moon or stars throughout the year,
 Or man or woman.  Yet I argue not
 Against Heav'n's hand or will, nor bate a jot
 Of heart or hope; but still bear up and steer
 Right onward.  What supports me, dost thou ask?
 The conscience, Friend, to have lost them overply'd
 In liberty's defence, my noble task,
 Of which all Europe talks from side to side.
 This thought might lead me through the world's vain mask,
 Content though blind, had I no better guide.
</pre>
    <p>
      Nothing can exceed the mild, subdued tone of this Sonnet, nor the striking
      grandeur of the concluding thought. It is curious to remark what seems to
      be a trait of character in the two first lines. From Milton's care to
      inform the reader that 'his eyes wore still clear, to outward view, of
      spot or blemish,' it would be thought that he had not yet given up all
      regard to personal appearance; a feeling to which his singular beauty at
      an earlier age might be supposed naturally enough to lead. Of the
      political or (what may be called) his <i>State-Sonnets,</i> those to
      Cromwell, to Fairfax, and to the younger Vane are full of exalted praise
      and dignified advice. They are neither familiar nor servile. The writer
      knows what is due to power and to fame. He feels the true, unassumed
      equality of greatness. He pays the full tribute of admiration for great
      acts achieved, and suggests becoming occasion to deserve higher praise.
      That to Cromwell is a proof how completely our poet maintained the
      erectness of his understanding and spirit in his intercourse with men in
      power. It is such a compliment as a poet might pay to a conqueror and head
      of the state without the possibility of self-degradation:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Cromwell, our chief of men, who through a cloud,
 Not of war only, but detractions rude,
 Guided by faith and matchless fortitude,
 To peace and truth thy glorious way hast plough'd,
 And on the neck of crowned fortune proud
 Hast rear'd God's trophies and his work pursued
 While Darwen stream with blood of Scots imbrued,
 And Dunbar field resounds thy praises loud,
 And Worcester's laureat wreath.  Yet much remains
 To conquer still; peace hath her victories
 No less renown'd than war: new foes arise
 Threatening to bind our souls with secular chains;
 Help us to save free conscience from the paw
 Of hireling wolves, whose gospel is their maw.
</pre>
    <p>
      The most spirited and impassioned of them all, and the most inspired with
      a sort of prophetic fury, is the one entitled, 'On the late Massacre in
      Piedmont.'
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Avenge, O Lord, thy slaughter'd saints, whose bones
 Lie scatter'd on the Alpine mountains cold;
 Even them who kept thy truth so pure of old,
 When all our fathers worshipp'd stocks and stones,
 Forgot not: in thy book record their groans
 Who were thy sheep, and in their ancient fold
 Slain by the bloody Piedmontese that roll'd
 Mother with infant down the rocks.  Their moans
 The vales redoubled to the hills, and they
 To Heav'n.  Their martyr'd blood and ashes sow
 O'er all the Italian fields, where still doth sway
 The triple Tyrant; that from these may grow
 A hundred fold, who having learn'd thy way
 Early may fly the Babylonian woe.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the Nineteenth Sonnet, which is also 'On his blindness,' we see the
      jealous watchfulness of his mind over the use of his high gifts, and the
      beautiful manner in which he satisfies himself that virtuous thoughts and
      intentions are not the least acceptable offering to the Almighty:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 When I consider how my light is spent
 Ere half my days, in this dark world and wide,
 And that one talent which is death to hide,
 Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent,
 To serve therewith my Maker, and present
 My true account, lest he returning chide;
 Doth God exact day-labour, light denied,
 I fondly ask: But patience to prevent
 That murmur, soon replies, God doth not need
 Either man's work or his own gifts; who best
 Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best; his state
 Is kingly; thousands at his bidding speed,
 And post o'er land and ocean without rest;
 They also serve who only stand and wait.
</pre>
    <p>
      Those to Mr. Henry Lawes <i>on his Airs,</i> and to Mr. Lawrence, can
      never be enough admired. They breathe the very soul of music and
      friendship. Both have a tender, thoughtful grace; and for their lightness,
      with a certain melancholy complaining intermixed, might be stolen from the
      harp of Aeolus. The last is the picture of a day spent in social
      retirement and elegant relaxation from severer studies. We sit with the
      poet at table and hear his familiar sentiments from his own lips
      afterwards:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Lawrence, of virtuous father virtuous son,
 Now that the fields are dank and ways are mire,
 Where shall we sometimes meet, and by the fire
 Help waste a sullen day, what may be won
 From the hard season gaining? Time will run
 On smoother, till Favonius re-inspire
 The frozen earth, and clothe in fresh attire
 The lily and rose, that neither sow'd nor spun.
 What neat repast shall feast us, light and choice,
 Of Attic taste, with wine, whence we may rise
 To hear the lute well-touched, or artful voice
 Warble immortal notes and Tuscan air?
 He who of these delights can judge, and spare
 To interpose them oft, is not unwise.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the last, 'On his deceased Wife,' the allusion to Alcestis is
      beautiful, and shows how the poet's mind raised and refined his thoughts
      by exquisite classical conceptions, and how these again were enriched by a
      passionate reference to actual feelings and images. It is this rare union
      that gives such voluptuous dignity and touching purity to Milton's
      delineation of the female character:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Methought I saw my late espoused saint
 Brought to me like Alcestis from the grave,
 Whom Jove's great son to her glad husband gave,
 Rescued from death by force, though pale and faint.
 Mine, as whom wash'd from spot of child-bed taint
 Purification in the old law did save,
 And such, as yet once more I trust to have
 Full sight of her in Heav'n without restraint,
 Came vested all in white, pure as her mind:
 Her face was veil'd, yet to my fancied sight
 Love, sweetness, goodness in her person shined
 So clear, as in no face with more delight:
 But O as to embrace me she inclined,
 I waked, she fled, and day brought back my night.
</pre>
    <p>
      There could not have been a greater mistake or a more unjust piece of
      criticism than to suppose that Milton only shone on great subjects, and
      that on ordinary occasions and in familiar life his mind was unwieldy,
      averse to the cultivation of grace and elegance, and unsusceptible of
      harmless pleasures. The whole tenor of his smaller compositions
      contradicts this opinion, which, however, they have been cited to confirm.
      The notion first got abroad from the bitterness (or vehemence) of his
      controversial writings, and has been kept up since with little meaning and
      with less truth. His Letters to Donatus and others are not more remarkable
      for the display of a scholastic enthusiasm than for that of the most
      amiable dispositions. They are 'severe in youthful virtue unreproved.'
      There is a passage in his prose-works (the Treatise on Education) which
      shows, I think, his extreme openness and proneness to pleasing outward
      impressions in a striking point of view. 'But to return to our own
      institute,' he says, 'besides these constant exercises at home, there is
      another opportunity of gaining experience to be won from pleasure itself
      abroad. <i>In those vernal seasons of the year, when the air is calm and
      pleasant, it were an injury and sullenness against Nature not to go out
      and see her riches, and partake in her rejoicing with Heaven and earth.</i>
      I should not therefore be a persuader to them of studying much then, but
      to ride out in companies with prudent and well-staid guides, to all
      quarters of the land,' etc. Many other passages might be quoted, in which
      the poet breaks through the groundwork of prose, as it were, by natural
      fecundity and a genial, unrestrained sense of delight. To suppose that a
      poet is not easily accessible to pleasure, or that he does not take an
      interest in individual objects and feelings, is to suppose that he is no
      poet; and proceeds on the false theory, which has been so often applied to
      poetry and the Fine Arts, that the whole is not made up of the
      particulars. If our author, according to Dr. Johnson s account of him,
      could only have treated epic, high-sounding subjects, he would not have
      been what he was, but another Sir Richard Blackmore.&mdash;I may conclude
      with observing, that I have often wished that Milton had lived to see the
      Revolution of 1688. This would have been a triumph worthy of him, and
      which he would have earned by faith and hope. He would then have been old,
      but would not have lived in vain to see it, and might have celebrated the
      event in one more undying strain!
